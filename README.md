# My Health Companion App
## Brief
Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to introduce our team project, the "First Responders App." As we navigate the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it's clear that we're living in a time of great volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, commonly known as the VUCA Model. While we've adapted to online education and implemented measures like lockdowns and vaccination drives, there's another critical issue we have yet to fully address: road accidents.

None of us want our loved ones to become victims of road accidents, yet we are all contributors to the problem. We often prioritize being on time for meetings or protecting our income, but in doing so, we overlook the lives tragically lost on the roads and the urgent need for medical assistance in these situations.

Shockingly, evidence shows that approximately 30% of deaths are caused by delayed ambulances or traffic hindrances. This raises the question of what kind of platform or infrastructure we can develop to provide those in need with a last-minute chance.

Keeping in mind the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our team has developed an app that focuses on two main SDGs: Good Health and Well-being, and Sustainable Cities and Communities.

Introducing the "My Health Companion App," an all-in-one solution that brings together medical personnel and offers valuable features for individuals who may have communication limitations. In emergency situations, the app also connects users with nearby doctors for immediate assistance.

## Challenges Identified:

1. Health deterioration during major lockdowns:
   The prolonged lockdowns have had a severe impact on people's physical and mental health. Many individuals have experienced a decline in their well-being, whether due to the loss of loved ones or other reasons. Additionally, accessing necessary medications has become challenging, with some pharmacies running out of stock or not having specific medicines available.

2. Lack of patient medical history:
   Amid the pandemic, doctors have faced difficulties in treating patients without access to their complete medical history. This uncertainty about a patient's previous conditions and allergies makes it challenging to provide effective and safe treatment.

3. Medication adherence and misuse:
   Another issue observed is the lack of adherence to prescribed medication schedules. Some individuals forget to take their medicines according to the prescribed dosage and timing, while others unintentionally consume more than the required amount. This situation raises concerns regarding patient safety and the effectiveness of the treatment.

4. Delayed emergency response:
   When accidents occur on the road, bystanders often assume someone else has already called for an ambulance, resulting in delays and reduced chances of timely medical assistance. The tendency to gather around without taking immediate action compounds the problem.

5. Accessibility for individuals with speech or hearing disabilities:
   A crucial aspect to consider is how individuals with speech or hearing disabilities can request emergency assistance. The existing system may not adequately address their needs, leaving them at a disadvantage in emergency situations.

To address these challenges, our team has developed the "First Responders App," an innovative solution that aims to revolutionize emergency response and healthcare access. By leveraging technology, we can effectively tackle these problems and ensure better health outcomes for all.


## Key Features 

1. Access previous health records:
This option allows users to conveniently access their past prescriptions, receipts, scans, vaccination records, and reports. No more worries about misplacing or forgetting important medical documents.

2. Find nearby pharmacies with specific medications:
   Users can easily locate nearby pharmacies that carry the specific medicines prescribed by their doctors. This feature ensures timely access to the required medications.

3. Book virtual or physical doctor appointments:
   Whether you're unable to visit a hospital due to your current situation or prefer a virtual consultation, this option enables you to book appointments with doctors conveniently.

4. Medication reminder:
   Never miss a dose again! This feature sends reminders to take medications according to the prescribed schedule, ensuring adherence to treatment plans.

5. Instant ambulance or healthcare service:
   With just a single tap, users can book an ambulance immediately by providing relevant information about the situation. Additionally, the app allows users to seek further assistance or help from nearby doctors based on their location, which is particularly valuable for individuals with communication limitations.
